# Python project

### PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset;

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;

- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period;

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period;

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### PyPoll

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast;

- A complete list of candidates who received votes;

- The percentage of votes each candidate won;

- The total number of votes each candidate won;

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
